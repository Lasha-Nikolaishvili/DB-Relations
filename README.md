# Database Relations Example

The following repository shows how to structure a many-to-many relationship database using sqlite.
 
## Usage

To use this script:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Run the script `main.py`. This will execute the main function, which creates tables and displays the number of students each advisor has.

## Requirements

- Currently, the project doesn't have any requirements besides Python.

## Notes

- The script assumes that an SQLite database file named `sqlite.db` exists in the current directory. If not, it will be created automatically.
